# Why Privacy Matters

In the digital age, privacy is not just a luxury; it's a fundamental right. Every time you go online, you leave a digital footprint.

## What is Digital Privacy?
Digital privacy refers to the protection of your personal information while you are connected to the Internet.

## Key Concepts
* **Data Collection**: How websites gather your info.
* **Consent**: Agreeing to share your data.
* **Security**: Protecting data from theft.

> "Privacy is not about having something to hide, but about having control over what you share."

# Creating Strong Passwords

A strong password is your first line of defense.

## Tips for Strong Passwords
* Use at least 12 characters.
* Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
* **Never** use personal info like birthdays.

## Example
Weak: \`password123\`
Strong: \`Tr0ub4dour&3\`
